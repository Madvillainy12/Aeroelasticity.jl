## Theory

This model uses geometrically exact beam theory (as implemented by the [GXBeam](https://github.com/byuflowlab/GXBeam.jl) package to model an interconnected assembly of nonlinear beams.  For more details, refer to the documentation for the [GXBeam](https://github.com/byuflowlab/GXBeam.jl) package.
